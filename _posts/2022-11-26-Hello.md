# Hellllooooooo

Hello, I really like Games Workshop games, particularly Kill Team and Warhammer Underwords, and wanted to start a site which talks about them.  So here it is.  I named it Yarrick's log after my favourite Imperial Guard Commissar.  For more details about his exploits you can read about him on [fandom](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Sebastian_Yarrick). 

My favourite armies/teams are:

* Veteran Guardsmen in Killteam
* Necrons and Imperial Guard in 40K
* Hexbane Hunters and  Drepur's Wraithcreepers in Warhammer Underworlds

Besides the games I would recommend the following tools for playing GM games:

* [Battlescribe](https://battlescribe.net/) - For organising your armies / teams
* [KTDash](https://ktdash.app/) - Makes pretty operative cards and rules for Kill Team
* [ElementalGames](https://elementgames.co.uk/) - Want up to 20% off GM prices (of course you do) - Element Games is a great supplier of models and boxed sets
* [CanYouRollaCrit](https://canyourollacrit.com/) - Well can you? Writes and talks about Kill Team and Underworlds on YouTube/Spotify
* Other excellent places I will fill out later

Thanks
